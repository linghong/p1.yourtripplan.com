   <h1>My Bio</h1>
 
   <h2>Hangzhou, My Hometown</h2>

<p>I was born in a beautiful town, Hangzhou,  a modern city but also famous for its wealth of culture and the beauty of the West Lake. As many of you probably had never been heard of the name, my hometown Hangzhou, located in the middle east coast of China and 110 mi  southwest  of Shanghai, is actually highly praised by numerous China's ancient poets and writers, and called the heaven in the earth in China.</p> 

<p>Places with natural beauty are easy to find  in the world, however, you won't find another beautiful place in the world that has so many folk stories, so many poems, so many artists' life and well-known politicians are with it. For examples, The most  two famous and sadly loving stories similar as Romiette and Julio came  from Hangzhou. You can still find the places where  the lovers met  and where they were sadly separated. Hangzhou  is also one of the seven ancient capitals in China, and the south end of China's  ancient Grand Cannel built on AD 689 stops in Hangzhou.</p>

<p>When I graduated from high school,  I studied biology at Zhejiang University, the best  college in Hangzhou and also is one of the top universities in China. Growing  up in such a beautiful place, I had never planned leaving it permanently  till I studied the graduate school at Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai, and started to be influenced by my schoolmates  whom almost all went to USA after graduated. </p>

<h2>My Road to USA</h2>

<p>Soon after I graduated,  I found a job in USA, However, my road to USA is very bumpy.  I failed in visa application. Unlike today, US Consulate are very welcome Chinese, getting a US visa was a very tough  thing.  Having failed the visa application several times, I decided to try another country. Thus I came to Berlin. 
Berlin is an attractive city. People are very friendly. I still remember my first morning in Berlin. </p>

<p>Even in a place that lots of students went abroad,  the information about Germany was scarce at that time.  I mistakenly thought  banks  would be also everywhere as they were  in any big city in China. So I brought US dollars and didn't exchange them  into German Mark. I arrived at Berlin at late night. The next morning, when I couldn't find a bank to exchange money, I  had to bring $20 to a cafeteria to buy breakfast and of course got rejected. A man stood nearby giving the clerk 10 Mark and told the clerk this would be used to pay for my meal .  I asked why, he answered "because you are hungry " and left. This is my first impression about Germany. A very warm welcome from that country.  </p>

<p>My job in the lab was easy. German people seem never work late or work in weekend and holidays.  I took the advantage of that and visited lots of places in Germany and in Europe. Germany is a nice place,  people are very  friendly, and weather is  also good, nevertheless, as a foreigner, you will always feel you were different from them. The  feeling  that " I am only a guest and not belonging to the country" always bothered me and eventually brought me  to New York.</p>

   <h2>My life in New York</h2>
<p>New York city is dirty, crowded, and noisy. Compare to Germany, people are far less warmhearted. You won't love that kind of place in the beginning, and may even feel a little bit frustrated. However, the longer you live there, the more you'll find the treasures behind it, eventually you will fall in love with it and don't want to leave any more. </p>

<p>In New York city, everyone is like me, coming from different countries either earlier or later, having different skin colors, and speaking different accent.  You can also find  almost all the food from your native countries that you have been accustomed  to for so many years. You won't feel you, as a foreigner, are only a stranger in that country. So I immediately felt home, a home that is not gorgeous and  not perfect, but anyway it is yours.</p>

 <p>In the working days, I became a busy scientist, doing the research with cultured cells and mice, playing with bottles, dishes and microplates, studying under microscopes,  monitoring incubators and equipments, etc. In the weekend, I walked around the city digging its precious assets:  the happy kids skating on the snow ground  in the winter of the Central Park, the crazy people in New Year's Time square,  the peculiar  parades celebrating  for their own country's holidays  in the fifth avenue, the long lines waiting outside of the cinemas  in  Broadway,  the gorgeous sunset on the blue seashore in the quite beach in Bronx, the amazing Manhattan skyline watched  from Brooklyn Heights...... Many people in New York city love to go to bars and clubs at night. I am not a fan of that, but I love the Broadway shows, the theatre,  the museums and the tons of exhibitions New York city always provides, and also  the feeling of you can go out to buy things even  in the very late of a night.</p>  

<h2>Digging into the Code World</h2>
<p>Two or three years ago, I wanted to build a website for a small business I wanted to try. I didn't have a clear idea how my website should look like. So I didn't want to spend money building a site that I would  change my mind soon and have to rebuilt it. I decided to learn to build a simple site by myself. After doing research, I found Wordpress was the best option for my purpose  because it  was easy to learn and had an amazing open source CMS with a large community, free themes and lots of plugins. </p>

<p>Not long later, I wanted to add some looks on my site that neither the theme nor  plugins provided. I  did internet search, took whatever I could found in the internet  that seemed  related and tested on my site. So my CSS code was mingled with the html codes. I also didn't have any idea whether they were from  html5 or html4 or Xhtml. Anyway, whatever worked, I took it. </p>

 <p>I gradually I felt it was too time consuming and I'd better to  learn the html and CSS codes.  I started to learn html and CSS on the internet, but I actually found the best way to learn was using a new and good book. It gave me much clearer explanation and has more useful examples. 
Unexpectedly, the more I am involved in the cold world, the more I found I loved in building website than the small business I initially tried to work on. I eventually decide to take a class, and see how my feeling will be, and that is why I am here in  this class. If it goes well, I'll take more classes.</p>

<h2>My Code Editor</h2>

<p>What's code editor I am using? Actually, in the very beginning, I was using notepad (not the notepad++). Since I only write a few lines of codes to add in my existing wordpress page, it seemed OK.  Later on,  I found a free Dreamweaver software in the internet, so I started to use Dreamweaver to write  codes.  It was only Dreamweaver CS3, but it was still helpful, since if I typed a wrong code the color would be different. Now after attending this course,  I am trying Sublime Text2. Hopefully it will be better than Dreamweaver. </p>
